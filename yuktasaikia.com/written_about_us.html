                    <h3>The Follow Requestü´¢</h3>
                    <p>It was one fine Sunday Afternoon and I had just gotten out of the shower, still in my towels. I checked my phone and found a follow request. Normally, I would ignore them, but something made me check yours, and to my shock, I saw 'its_ri04.' I wondered if 'Ri' meant Riti, but how would that even happen. But then I clicked on your profile and saw 'Yukta', which was actually YOUR name, and its fair to say that I was flabbergasted. It felt almost too good to be true, but I also saw "AVS'24", which meant it HAD to be you. I can never forget that feeling and that day :) </p>

                    <h3>The Diwali Break & The First Callü™î
                    </h3>
                    <p>I think we were sort of friends by now and it was Diwali now. You got your holidays. You took your two friends with you too. Your Chinese culture admirer and also the friend whom you kind of fought with? Ended up texting her bs about her only? rmb? Lmao anyways, you got drunk and you texted me n shit too. I think we got closer now, and then perhaps I had the best Diwali of my life! But it didn't just end there, two days later I suppose, you texted me, "Yk even tho I rarely get my phone, you can call me sometimes". That was the beginning of something and we talked for the first time the next day. I mean there was some cute awkwardness to it but.... it was still fun, right? Then there was this whole beer can thing and then we met for the first time without our parents haha! I mean that was very rude of you to not pay attention to what I was saying and just stare at that guy of yours. wtv, what's done is done but thanks for the beer ig ! </p>

                    <h3>The calls that followed :)</h3>
                    <p> We started talking over calls now and then, whenever you'd get your phone ig. And it was all nice and fun, hours and hours. It was all special, at least to me. I guess hearing each other's voices helped us bond more :) And I think there was really something special about our calls. Sorry, its 4AM as I write this and I genuinely have no words to explain our early calls. Maybe because I can feel those calls now, I don't wanna tear up so skipping to the next blog!</p>

                    <h3>Happy New Year !üéä
                    </h3>
                    <p> It was late December and we weren't really on the best terms but hey, we were talking ! I think it was a few days past christmas and we were talking a lil more than usual now. I was slightly intoxicated on the night of 31st and as usual, I came to you to yap. A lil later, it was the beginning of the year and I think we were each other first wishes. You then pointed it out that I was your first wish (not counting your Mom and Gucci) now that, really meant something to me. I entered the year with you :)</p>

                    <h3> JanuaryüçÄ
                    </h3>
                    <p> I think this was the month when we started getting attached to each other. You'd be bothered by me at times, like those early sleeping incidents that started in January. It was when the calls started again. It was Bihu, and there was this brief call where we talked. It wasn't much, but it started the whole calling each other thing again. Perhaps our voices connected us more than texts, also why it always sorted things out between us every time. By the end of your winter break, you'd finally hint at us being a thing, and you'd also start getting mad at small stuff. So yeah, towards the end of the month, I think it's safe to say that we ended up being more than just friends!</p>

                <h3> PreBoards & Boardsüìö
                </h3>
                    <p>Finally, it was the most 'crucial' period of the most important year of your school life‚Äî12th Boards. I remember everything about it: your preboards, the subjects that went well, and the subjects that didn‚Äôt. You'd update me and tell me everything‚Äîit was all so sweet! In no time, preboards turned into boards. The tension prevailed, but it still went fine, didn't it? I think you cried once too and I think it was kinda cute. And it all ended with a happy ending didn't it? Miss 88 :) </p>

                    <h3> The Month Of LOVE‚ù§Ô∏è </h3>
                        <p> February was indeed a special month for us. I believe we evolved the most during this month. The Zoom calls, the Google Chat conversations, and all the things you did with your laptop to contact me were memorable. I mean, it was technically all your ideas; I wouldn‚Äôt have thought of Zoom meetings or Gchat convos. If it weren‚Äôt for you, we wouldn‚Äôt be here. I would always joke about how I highly doubted if you even cared about me, to which you always replied, 'I wouldn‚Äôt be doing this if I didn‚Äôt.' You made it clear that you did, and back then you truly did, I guess. Do you remember walking around the corridors with your MacBook in hand? Well, it was cute. And by the end of the month, you were home, and we were closer than ever :)</p>

                        <h3> 4th Of March üéÇ
                        </h3>
                            <p>And then, the day finally came‚Äîa date I had remembered for the past seven years. The letters and gifts were just normal, but what wasn't normal was my excitement and how happy I was for you on that day. And also, the feeling of knowing that you liked me back, which you'd deny today. Well, I wouldn't know what to say to that, but you really made me feel like you did. The girl I knew since childhood was 19 all of a sudden. When the day ended, you said your mom hugged you and was really happy when she looked at you. I mean, of course, she was, but you also told me that you think one of the reasons for her happiness was the fact that you were talking with me and not someone else :) I really wanted to meet you that day but it's fine. Next birthday??? Probably not, but let's just end it on a happy note :)</p>

                            <h3> Life wasn't all sunny and neither were we ü´†
                            </h3>
                                <p>Something was off towards the end of your boards, and I couldn‚Äôt feel your energy anymore. It wasn‚Äôt the same. Maybe I know the reasons now, but back then, I didn‚Äôt. I found something I wasn‚Äôt supposed to, and when I showed it to you, your response was far from what I expected. Well, as it turns out, the next day, I was blocked. I mean, it kinda sounds funny now, and I think we‚Äôve joked about this incident too, but back then, it wasn‚Äôt funny at all. But anyway, I‚Äôm not complaining about it anymore; this blog is just a highlight of that incident :)</p>

                                <h3> 6th Of Aprilüòò

                                </h3>
                                    <p> Then came the day when everything happened. We met at IMP Theatre. I arrived on time, while you, of course, made me wait. I waited for you to come through the back alley‚Äîmaybe to avoid other people, but who knows? And then you came, and we finally met. I can visualize everything as I type this, but I‚Äôm sure you remember it too. From entering through the wrong way to finding our seats, it all felt like a blur.
<br>
                                        It didn‚Äôt take long before things started happening between us. From me asking for your hand to putting my hand somewhere more intimate, from me kissing your neck to you kissing my lips, everything happened that day. The hugs and pecks were pretty wholesome too. I didn‚Äôt want the day to end, but it finally did‚Äîwith a little dent on my finger ü•π. Deep down, I wished to be able to live more of such days with no one else but you. :)</p>

                                    <h3> And Everything That Has Happened Ever Since ü•π
                                    </h3>
                                        <p> A lot has happened since then‚Äîboth good and bad. At times, it felt like a roller coaster, but now that I think about it, I guess it was all just part of the story. There were times you really tried to cut me off, and there was a time I did too. But maybe we weren't meant to lose each other back then. Is that what you think? I thought so too, but I've realized now that maybe it was all supposed to be like this. Perhaps we were just meant to hang on by threads and edges, all while being part of the process. Even now, we aren't on the best terms, but we shouldn't just end, should we?
                                                <br>
                                            I tried to prep you for CUET, and I couldn't be of much help from my own home, but I did what I could. I mean, I did help you cheat on a test, didn't I? üòÇ Well, it did work, and we can't forget about the movies either. And why am I mentioning all of this? Do I want credit or validation? Not really. I just wanted to let you know that it was all fun, and I enjoyed doing all of that for you. To be honest, these aren't things that I typically enjoy, but I did them willingly because it was for you. Perhaps if I had the chance, I would have continued to do so, for as long as I could :) </p>
