                    This website is intended to be something like an album. They say people are replaceable, memories aren't. This webiste is a digital space filled with cherished memories, loving letters, and thoughtful messages, all curated to express feelings that words alone often fail to capture.
                </p>

                    Through this website, I wanted to create a lasting impression and a space where we can revisit our beautiful journey together. Each section, from letters to memories, is crafted with love and dedication, hoping to bring a smile and warmth to your heart (well it prolly wouldn't but nothhing there's I can do about that, right?)
                </p>

                    The point of this website is simple yet profound – it's a testament to our shared moments, a digital scrapbook of the time we were eachother's favourite, and a reminder of the love and care that binded us. It's a place where you can feel cherished and know how much you mean to me.

                    This website needs to be maintained, the domain needs to be renewed, the blogs will be updated with newer ones ever once in a while and I'll probably bring new stuff here too. So just know, this website isn't a one time thing, this website will still exist even if we loose contact. So maybe just check once in a while.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for being a part of my life and for making it so much more beautiful. This website is for you, to celebrate us, and to keep our memories alive forever.
